          <p class="about-me">
            My family and I love spending time camping and hiking together. It gives us 
            the chance to explore new trails at our own pace. One of our favorite adventures 
            was conquering Mt. Whitney, the tallest peak in the contiguous U.S. standing 
            at 14,505 feet! The hike was long and grueling, but every step was worth it 
            for the stunning views we experienced along the way.

          <p class="about-me">
            I enjoy exercising, especially swimming, running, and cycling, as they keep me active 
            and continually challenge me. A few years ago, I achieved a lifelong dream of completing 
            a full Ironman. The months of early-morning training were tough but incredibly rewarding 
            because the journey taught me about resilience, discipline, and pushing my limits.

          <h2>Cooking</h2>

          <p class="about-me">
            Although I’m not the best cook, I love experimenting with all kinds of recipes and discovering 
            new flavors. One of my signature dishes is Coconut Mochi Cake, which is a favorite among 
            friends and family. I also enjoy making hearty soups like chili or chicken tortilla soup. One 
            of my personal favorites to prepare and eat is sous vide duck—it’s a fun and rewarding way to 
            create a perfectly cooked, flavorful dish.
